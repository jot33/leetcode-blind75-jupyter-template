# How to start using Jupyter notebooks 

- What is a Jupyter Notebook?
    - Free, open-source tool to conveniently take notes and run python code snippets in one place
    - Watch the first few minutes of this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk) to get a general idea.
- How do I get it?
    - Here are some suggestions (there are a ton of options and tutorials online) - ***Choose your preferred method***
        - On linux or macOS
            - Requires **python3** and **pip** installed: check in terminal with `python3 --version` and `pip --version` commands
            - As explained on [Jupyter install page](https://jupyter.org/install)
            - Install JupyterLab with `pip install jupyterlab` then launch with `jupyter-lab` command
            - or install classic Jupyter Notebook with `pip install notebook` then launch with `jupyter notebook` command
        - Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) - Jupyter is included
        - Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
            - In vscode, bring up extensions with `ctrl+shift+x` then type "Jupyter"
            - Click on the Jupyter extension from Microsoft, then click install
            - See this [vscode doc on using Jupyter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)

# Template overview

- The TOC has problem lists split up by problem type.
    - Headers have a navigation bar linking to various sections in the notebook.
    - The problem links (e.g. "**Two Sum**") navigate to that problem in the notebook.
    - **Web Links** navigate to that problem on leetcode.com
- Checkboxes are formated with HTML (due to render issues with `- [ ]` markdown format in some environments)
- Update checkboxes as follows:
    - `double-click` or press `Enter` in cell.
    - `<input type="checkbox">` = Unchecked (<input type="checkbox">)
    - `<input type="checkbox" checked>` = Checked (<input type="checkbox" checked>)
