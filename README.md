# How to start using Jupyter notebooks 

- What is a Jupyter Notebook?
    - Free, open-source tool to conveniently take notes and run python code snippets in one place
    - Watch the first few minutes of this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk) to get a general idea.
- How do I get it?
    - Here are some suggestions (there are a ton of options and tutorials online) - ***Choose your preferred method***
        - [Jupyter Official](https://jupyter.org/install) - install from command line with Python's package manager `pip`:
            - Open terminal or powershell and use the following commands: 
            - `pip -V` and `python3 -V` - checks package manager and python versions
                - Linux/Unix/MacOS: should come preinstalled with some version of Python
                - Windows: if not already installed, download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
                    - ***Note***: check the "add to PATH" box during install to allow for command-line operation
            - `pip install jupyter` - installs jupyter and required dependencies
            - `jupyter-lab` - Launches Jupyter Lab in default browser
            - `jupyter notebook` - Launches the classic Jupyter Notebook
        - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) - Open-source toolkit with Jupyter included
        - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
            - In vscode, bring up extensions with `ctrl+shift+x` then type "Jupyter"
            - Click on the Jupyter extension from Microsoft, then click install
            - See this [vscode doc on using Jupyter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)
